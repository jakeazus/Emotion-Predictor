## Background
---
Today there are various facial recognition softwares that exist, but what's truly missing is knowing the facial expressions that individuals make. Imagine knowing how an audience feels about a certain presentation or presenter based on their facial expression which can include: a Presidental speech, sporting events, a movie, standup comedy. The model that we have successfully built identifies an individualâ€™s facial expression by taking a picture of them and using machine learning technologies to predict their emotion.
