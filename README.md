# Emotion Predictor Machine Learning Project

By: _**Nadia Richards, Jake Azus, Noah Goldstein, Perry Reynolds**_
## Background
---
Today there are various facial recognition softwares that exist, but what's truly missing is knowing the facial expressions that individuals make. Imagine knowing how an audience feels about a certain presentation or presenter based on their facial expression which can include: a Presidental speech, sporting events, a movie, standup comedy. The model that we have successfully built identifies an individualâ€™s facial expression by taking a picture of them and using machine learning technologies to predict their emotion. 

## Tools and Technology Used for Analysis
---
* VSCode
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Google Colab
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* CSS
* HTML
* Flask App

## Machine Learning Model Details
---
* Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze emotions
* Trained model using approximately 28,000 grayscale emotion images
* Tested model using approximately 7,000 grayscale emotion images
